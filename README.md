# This plugin was an experiment! It is now archived.

I advise you take a look at [Upper](https://github.com/ostark/upper) for Craft 3 by the wonderful [Oliver Stark](https://github.com/ostark).

# Falcon plugin for Craft CMS

Make Craft fly. Well, stick a reverse proxy in front of it then auto-magically invalidate the right caches.

## Installation

To install Falcon, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `falcon` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/joshangell/falcon.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require joshangell/falcon`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `falcon` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.
6. Copy the code below into `craft/app/etc/templating/BaseTemplate.php`, inserting it after `if ($cacheService) { ... }` in the `_includeElementInTemplateCaches` method: 

```php
$falcon = craft()->getComponent('falcon_templates', false);
if ($falcon) {
    $falcon->includeElement($elementId);
}

```

Yes that was a core hack, which is always necessary on Craft 2.

Falcon works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## Falcon Overview

Currently very un-configurable.

The Varnish URL is set to `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`, the headers used are `xkey` specific, silly things are happening like Matrix blocks are getting their IDs sent out, there are no Tasks and custom keys arenâ€™t purged.
 
But hey, this is basically still classed as an experiment.

## Configuring Falcon

You need to do this in your layout:

```twig
{% falcon %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>...</head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
{% endfalcon %}
```

Then elsewhere:
```twig
{% extends "_layout" %}

{% falcon_addkey 'section:news' %}

{% block content %}
...
{% endblock %}
```

## Using Falcon

## Falcon Roadmap

These things need to happen before it can be considered ready for use:

* Listen to specific entry on save, if new, send `section:handle` purge requests or whatever we do when doing the extra tagging during render.
* Probably expand that whole thing to be configurable so that people can do whatever they like.
* Make the xkey header bit configurable, as well as the actual purge tooling so that we can swap between fastly and BYO varnish.
* Make cache interface configurable incl URL and type of interface.
* Send PURGEs as Task so they can be queued up.
* Check a configurable list of dis-allowed element types to ignore from auto element ID collection, like Matrix/Neo/SuperTable blocks.
* Make a Craft 3 version without a core hack. Brandon said something about swapping out core components once that makes me think this is possible.
